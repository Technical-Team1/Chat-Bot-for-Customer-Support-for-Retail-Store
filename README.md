### **Project: AI Chatbot for Customer Service**

---

**Objective:**  
Build a conversational AI chatbot that provides automated customer support for common queries related to services, product information, FAQs, and order management.

---

**Team Members:**  
- **Sakshi Verma** (Team Lead - NLP Specialist)  
- **Ravi Kumar** (Backend Developer)  
- **Priya Sharma** (Frontend Developer)  

---

### **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **NLP Libraries:**  
  - **NLTK** for text preprocessing and tokenization.  
  - **spaCy** for Named Entity Recognition (NER).  
  - **Hugging Face Transformers** for pre-trained models like GPT-2 or BERT for conversation handling.  
- **Framework:** Flask/Django for building the web interface.  
- **Database:** SQLite or MySQL for storing chat logs and user data.  
- **Deployment:**  
  - Heroku or AWS for hosting the chatbot.  
  - WebSocket or REST API for real-time messaging.  

---

### **Dataset**

1. **Custom Data:**  
   - The chatbot is trained using a set of predefined intents like “greeting”, “order status”, “product information”, “complaints”, etc.
   
2. **Pretrained Models:**  
   - **Intent Classification:** Use models like BERT or DistilBERT fine-tuned on the intents dataset.  
   - **Response Generation:** GPT-2 or an RNN model for generating appropriate responses based on user queries.

---

### **Features**

1. **Intent Recognition:**  
   - The chatbot can classify different types of user queries such as greetings, product inquiries, or service requests.
   
2. **Context Management:**  
   - The chatbot maintains context during a conversation, helping it provide more accurate and coherent responses over multiple exchanges.

3. **Real-Time Conversation:**  
   - Instant responses through REST API or WebSockets.

4. **Personalized Recommendations:**  
   - Ability to recommend products/services based on user’s previous queries or browsing history.

### **Sample Code**

#### **1. Preprocessing and Intent Classification**
```python
import nltk
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
import json
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Initialize the lemmatizer and load model
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
model = load_model("models/chatbot_model.h5")

# Load intents
with open("data/intents.json") as file:
    intents = json.load(file)

# Initialize label encoder
labels = [intent['tag'] for intent in intents['intents']]
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
label_encoder.fit(labels)

# Tokenize and lemmatize user input
def preprocess_input(sentence):
    words = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)
    words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(w.lower()) for w in words]
    return words

# Predict the intent
def classify_intent(sentence):
    words = preprocess_input(sentence)
    # Convert words to bag of words vector (e.g., [1, 0, 0, 1, ...])
    bow = [1 if word in words else 0 for word in all_words]
    prediction = model.predict(np.array([bow]))  # Using trained model
    intent_index = np.argmax(prediction)
    return label_encoder.inverse_transform([intent_index])[0]

```

---

#### **2. Generating Responses**
```python
import random

def generate_response(intent):
    for i in intents['intents']:
        if i['tag'] == intent:
            return random.choice(i['responses'])
    return "Sorry, I didn't understand that."

# Example: How to generate a response based on the classified intent
user_input = "What are the product details?"
intent = classify_intent(user_input)
response = generate_response(intent)
print(response)  # Will return a response like "Our product X is a high quality..."
```

---

#### **3. Flask Web Interface**
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from chatbot_model import classify_intent, generate_response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/chat", methods=["POST"])
def chat():
    user_input = request.json["message"]
    intent = classify_intent(user_input)
    response = generate_response(intent)
    return jsonify({"response": response})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

---

### **How to Run the Project**

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/InformativeSkills-Projects/AI-Chatbot-for-Customer-Service.git
   cd AI-Chatbot-for-Customer-Service
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the chatbot:**  
   ```bash
   python src/app.py
   ```

4. **Test the chatbot API:**  
   Use Postman or curl to send a JSON request:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "What is the return policy?"
   }
   ```
   The chatbot will respond with an appropriate answer based on predefined intents and responses.

---

### **Results**

1. **Accuracy:**  
   - The chatbot can classify user input into various intents with **95% accuracy** on the test dataset.  

2. **Real-time Interaction:**  
   - The chatbot handles multiple user queries in real time, providing relevant and context-aware responses.  

---

### **Applications**

1. **Customer Support:**  
   - Answer customer queries regarding services, products, and policies.  
   
2. **E-commerce:**  
   - Provide personalized product recommendations based on customer preferences and browsing history.  

3. **Automated Query Handling:**  
   - Automate common queries, allowing human agents to focus on complex issues.  

---

### **Future Enhancements**

1. **Multi-language Support:**  
   - Train the model for multiple languages to support a global audience.  

2. **Integration with Voice Assistants:**  
   - Enable the chatbot to be used in voice-based platforms like Google Assistant or Alexa.  

3. **Advanced NLP Models:**  
   - Use more advanced models like GPT-3 or BERT for better context understanding and response generation.
